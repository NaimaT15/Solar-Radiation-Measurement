1. Project Overview
Purpose: Analysis of solar potential in Togo, Sierra Leone, and Benin to determine the best locations for solar energy installations.
Data Used: Minute-level solar irradiance and weather data collected over a year from the three countries.
2. Development Process
Data Collection: Details on where the data was sourced and what it includes.
Data Cleaning: Steps taken to handle missing values, outliers, and other anomalies.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Summary statistics, time-series analysis, correlation analysis, and visualizations.
Comparative Analysis: Comparison of sensor readings across the countries to identify the best candidate for solar installations.
Final Report: Compilation of findings into a comprehensive report.
3. Data Preprocessing
Loading Data: How the data was loaded into the analysis environment.
Cleaning Data: Specific steps for cleaning the dataset.
Feature Engineering: Adding calculated fields for better analysis.
Data Normalization: Techniques used to normalize data for comparison.
4. Analysis Techniques
Time Series Analysis: Observing trends over time.
Correlation Analysis: Identifying relationships between variables.
Histogram Analysis: Understanding data distributions.
Z-Score Analysis: Detecting and managing outliers.
5. Results
Findings: Sierra Leone identified as the best candidate for solar installations, followed by Benin and Togo.
Rationale: Sierra Leone had the most consistent and highest solar irradiance.
