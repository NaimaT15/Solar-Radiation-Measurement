Project Overview


Purpose: Analyze solar potential in Togo, Sierra Leone, and Benin to find the best location for solar energy installations.

Data: Minute-level solar irradiance and weather data from these three countries over one year.

Development Process

Data Collection: Gathered solar and weather data for each country.

Data Cleaning: Removed missing values, outliers, and anomalies.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed data trends, correlations, and distributions.

Comparison: Compared data across countries to identify the best solar potential.


Analysis Techniques

Time Series: Observed changes over time.

Correlation: Identified relationships between variables.

Histograms: Examined data distributions.

Z-Score: Detected and managed outliers.


Results
Best Candidate: Sierra Leone had the highest and most consistent solar irradiance, making it the top candidate for solar installations.
